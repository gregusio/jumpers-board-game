The aim of the game is to move all your pawns to the positions occupied at the beginning by your opponent,
that is, the opposite, extreme two lines of fields. The player who first accomplishes this - wins.
Main rules of the pawn movement in the game.
You can:
 - move your pawn to any adjacent free field horizontally or vertically (forward, backward or sideways)
 - jump over your own or your opponent's pawn from the field directly adjacent to the jumped pawn to the field directly behind it
 - you can jump several of your or your opponent's pawns from a field directly adjacent to the pawn you are jumping to a field directly behind them
 - you can make a whole series of jumps with one pawn according to the previous two rules - changing the direction of subsequent jumps is possible
